By default, the system uses the Bundle instance state to save information about each View object when the activity is destroyed 
and recreated.
To save additional data about the activity state, you must override the onSaveInstanceState() callback and onRestoreInstanceState() 

Implict vs explicit intent
Implicit intents do not declare the class name of the component to start, but instead declare an action to perform

To allow other apps to start your activity, you need to add an <intent-filter> element in your manifest file for the corresponding
<activity> element with <action>, <data> and <category>(which is normally defualt) element
setResult()  and startActivityForResult() if you want a result from the activity


Beginning in Android 6.0 (API level 23), users grant permissions to apps while the app is running, not when they install the app
System permissions are divided into two categories, normal and dangerous:Dangerous permissions can give the app access to the user's 
confidential data.

Best practice for runtime permission
You can explicitly ask permission to get the full control of the app you're using but this will add complexity as you have design the
UI. if the user doesn't grant the permission (or revokes it later on), your app becomes unable to perform the operation at all.
Quite often your app can avoid requesting a permission by using an intent instead

How to make app for different screen sizes?
1. Always use dp (density independent pixels )units the base for this is medium density screen. for low & high the system scales
2. Provide alternative bit map resources for different densities.  Place all your launcher icons in the res/mipmap-[density]/ folders,
rather than the res/drawable-[density]/ folders. the resources in drawable/ are the default drawable resources. you can also provide 
orientation qualifier
3. provide different layouts for different screen sizes

To add support for more languages, create additional values directories inside res/ that include a hyphen 
and the ISO language code at the end of the directory name.For example, values-es/. 
Android loads the appropriate resources according to the locale settings of the device at run time.
