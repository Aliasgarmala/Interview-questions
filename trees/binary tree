Max # of nodes on i th level  = 2^i;

Max # of nodes in the tree(complete binary tree) 2^(i+1) - 1

if i is the index of the node then it's left child will be at (2i+1) & the rigth child will be at (2i+2)
and its parent will be at (i-1)/2

tress are used since it can be traversed in many ways, not like arrays
preOrder(DLR)
inOrder(LDR)
postOrder(LRD)
where D is visiting the node

the way these traversal works eg preOrder 
Step1) visit the node (break, start again)
Step2) that node is visited in step1 so move to the left(break, start all over again)
Step2) so print the node in step2 (because that's the step1 in a new iteration)

void preOrder(Node root){

  if(root != null){
    
    System.out.println(root.data);
    preOrder(root.left);
    preOrder(root.rigth);
    
  }
}
